<center><h1>hello world</h1></center>
<center><p>Ravi found a small seed on the road while walking home from school. Instead of throwing it away, he planted it in a pot near his window. Every day, he watered it and spoke to it softly. Weeks passed, and nothing happened. Ravi almost gave up, but he continued caring for it patiently. One morning, he saw a tiny green sprout pushing through the soil. He felt proud and excited. Months later, the plant grew tall and bloomed with bright yellow flowers. Ravi learned that patience and care can turn even the smallest seed into something beautiful and full of life.</p></center>
